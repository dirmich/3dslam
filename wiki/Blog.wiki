After a lot of time without uploading anything full upload of SLAM2.0
new on this version: 
  * Quaternions instead of rodrigues
  * Easy architecture
  * Joint compatibility test
  * Returned to harris for feature detection.
  * Full 3D interface using OSG
Current results some stability in simulated points through 10 to 12 frames then diverges
Real images diverge in the 2 to 3 frame.
